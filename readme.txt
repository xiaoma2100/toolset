近年来，随着数字电视技术发展的深入，数字电视机顶盒市场逐渐饱和，再加上移动互联网的大力发展，给传统的数字电视机顶盒市场带来了一些挑战。在数字电视机顶盒市场，传统的数字电视机顶盒不仅要面对来自互联网机顶盒（如IPTV、OTT等）带来的挑战，还要面对来自移动互联网中各种手机视频APP的挑战。面对这些挑战，各地的数字电视运营商和供应商在不断探索新的技术和服务。比如市场上的融合型数字电视机顶盒，智慧教育、HBBTV服务和多屏互动技术。但是这些技术和服务存在着单机成本过高、对网络带宽依赖度高等问题。多屏互动虽然能够将手机上的资源分享到电视机上，但是无法在手机上观看数字电视网络中的数字电视直播节目，而用户对在手机上观看数字电视直播节目又有切实的需求。
本课题研究了在家庭网络环境下，多终端数字电视节目共享系统的设计与实现。本课题所设计系统分为客户端和服务端两部分，服务端改造自现有数字电视机顶盒平台，将它接入家庭局域网。客户端是一个移动端APP，运行在同样接入家庭局域网的移动终端上。服务端通过数字电视网络获取增值服务授权信息、数字电视节目信息等数据，通过REST ful API向客户端提供登录认证、节目浏览等功能。同时，服务端从数字电视网络中获取节目音视频数据，通过流媒体服务向客户端提供节目播放能力。为保证数字电视节目数据的安全性，本课题还设计了数字版权管理子系统，用来保证从服务端到客户端之间的数字电视节目音视频数据的安全性。 
测试结果表明，本系统可以通过移动终端播放来自数字电视网络的数字电视节目，播放稳定流畅，传输链路安全。该系统既保护了数字电视运营商的现有投资，增加了他们的收入，又可以提高数字电视用户的用户体验，从而吸引更多用户，带动数字电视机顶盒市场的增长。



In recent years, with the development of digital TV technology, the digital TV set-top box market is gradually saturated, coupled with the vigorous development of mobile Internet, it brings some challenges to the traditional digital TV set-top box market. In the digital TV set-top box market, the traditional digital TV set-top box not only face the challenges brought by Internet set-top boxes (such as IPTV, OTT, etc.), but also face the challenges from various mobile video APP in the mobile Internet. Faced with these challenges, digital TV operators and suppliers around the world are constantly exploring new technologies and services. For example, the integrated digital TV set-top box, smart education services, HBBTV services and multi-screen interactive technology. However, these technologies and services have problems such as high box cost and high dependence on Internet bandwidth. Although multi-screen interaction can share the resources on the mobile phone to the TV, it can't watch the live digital TV programs in the digital TV network on the mobile phone, and users have practical demand for watching the live digital TV programs on the mobile phone. 
This thesis studies the design and implementation of multi-terminal digital TV program sharing system in the home network environment. The system consists two parts: client and server. The server is transformed from the existing digital TV set-top box platform let it connected to the home LAN. The client is a mobile APP running on the mobile terminal that connected to the same home LAN. The server obtains value-added service authorization information, digital TV program information and other data through the digital TV network, and provides login authentication, program browsing functions to the client through the REST ful API. At the same time, the server obtains the program audio and video data from the digital TV network, and provides the program playing server for the client through the streaming media service. In order to ensure the security of digital TV program data, this thesis also designed a digital copyright management subsystem to ensure the security of audio and video data of digital TV programs from the server to the client. 
The test results show that the system can play digital TV programs from the digital TV network on the mobile terminal, and the playback is stable and smooth, and the transmission link is secure. The system not only protects the existing investment of digital TV operators, increases their revenue, but also enhances the user experience of digital TV users, thereby attracting more users and driving the growth of the digital TV set-top box market.
